# What's This?

This is the dir housing the app that is used to develop and exemplify usage of the world-daylight-map library.

# Notes

- This example dir is auto-generated by tsdx and uses parcel to bundle and dev-serve the code.
- I found parcel very difficult to configure; in particular, something as simple as dev-serving static files proved to be a time-sink. I eventually found that I could serve images from the root dir and decided just to settle with this because it's just for dev/exemplification purposes
